# In Stagrâm, a Zøncøm!

*by Tikto Tweet*

Ten thousand years before the age of man,  
When tales of ducks and goats were but a dream,  
Indomitable forces roamed the land:  
The Zøncøm! Just the name evokes a scream!

Primordial anathemas, jaws unhinged,  
Devouring all content in their path.  
From Ghost Forrest was sighted, on the fringe,  
A Zøncøm, set to destroy fore and aft.

Together, Stagrâm's children fought the foe,  
Denying it the webs for which it vied,  
They starved the beast, stopping it to grow,  
And with a greedy bellow, there it died.

More Zøncøm slumber 'neath the ocean's churn,  
And without vigilance they will return...
